# ğŸ§® Two Sum Problem

Welcome to the **Two Sum** algorithm implementation! This classic problem is a favorite in technical interviews and competitive programming. It demonstrates understanding of **hashing**, **time complexity**, and **efficient problem-solving** strategies.

## ğŸ“Œ Problem Statement

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the **two numbers** such that they **add up to the target**.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

---

## ğŸ’¡ Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so return [0, 1]
```
